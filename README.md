Empirical Research Task

This is the co-project of Lennart Joop and Julia Daetz. We are currently students at TU Dresden and do this project as part of the empirical research task lead by Prof. Lessmann and Sarah Zeller. 

We study the impact of AFD voting results as a proxy for xenophobia on the migration decisions of EU migrants living in Germany.
 

In the beginning of the project you should run the following code:
```{r}
renv::hydrate()
library(here)
```
To create the whole database used for our regression run the master script that is in the output "ordner" with the name "Master_Script.R".

To recreate our regression results, run the "Regression.R" file afterwards which is also in our "output" folder.
