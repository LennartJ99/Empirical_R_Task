This document presents the econometric approach we used in our research project, as described in Milestone 3.

## Economic Model

Flowchart function of the economic model @Julia xenophobia--\> AFD voting results --\> impact on EU Migrants

(schau dir die remarks bei dem punkt an, migrations entscheidungen werden durch viele dinge beeinflusst, AFD ergebnisse (also xenophobia ) eins davon)\

## Setting

**Endogenous Variable:** Xenophobia which we proxy by using AFD voting results

**Main Outcome Variable:** The percentage change of the number of EU migrants

Our observation units are 299 German voting districts. We run four different regressions in four years. We want to find the impact of AFD voting results in the elections 2017 and 2021 on the change of EU migrants 3 months and 15 months after the election.

Because AFD voting results are non-binary, we observe a treatment intensity instead of a treatment effect. Each unit of observation has a different treatment intensity which is based on the AFD voting shares.

## Mechanism

@Julia kannst du hier den 1. part schreiben? also die story unserer Regression, bzw hier w√ºrde ich gerne deinen Einleitungstext reinnehmen.

Due to our analysis being a simple regression, it is possible to test direct relationships between endogenous and main outcome variable. We plan on running simple regressions that just show the relation between our two main variables, reverse regressions to test for reverse causalities and simple regressions between our control variables and the main outcome variable.

## Sources of Bias and Identification

The connection we are trying to evaluate is hard to isolate cleanly. There are many factors that influence migration decisions in Europe:

-   economic opportunities such as potential incomes
-   access to healthcare
-   access to good education for the children
-   social factors such as child support, the access to other family members or a social group of people of similar culture
-   political climate in home and destination country
