## Introduction

Existing research on migration decisions mainly focusses on migrants' personal factors and conditions in their countries of origin. However, the conditions in potential destination countries, including societal attitudes towards immigrants, have been less explored. This study addresses this gap by examining how a country's welcoming culture influences migration decisions of foreigners. To find a suitable proxy for a country's welcoming culture, we look at the recent election results of parties known for their strong views on immigration. In the most recent European elections, the populist and far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD), emerged as the second strongest party in Germany, significantly ahead of the Green Party, which distinguishes itself greatly from the AfD through its progressive stance on the migration debate. Known for its negative attitudes toward migration, the AfD's 2017 election program, for example, was highly critical of multiculturalism, arguing for the preservation of the 'German Leitkultur' and against the acceptance of refugees. Conversely to previous research, that has already shown a positive relationship between the number of immigrants and increased support for right-wing parties, this study aims to analyze whether the strength of right-wing parties influences migrants' choice of destination. Specifically, it aims to answer the following question: How does the AfD vote share affect the migration decisions of EU foreigners in Germany? To do so, we perform a linear regression analysis using AfD election results from the 2017 and 2021 German federal elections at the district level, as well as data on changes in EU migration from the Federal Statistical Office. While it was initially understood as soft eurosceptic and socially conservative party (Quelle) when founded in 2013, the AfD shifted its focus to immigration issues following the 2015 refugee crisis. We therefore find it reasonable to use post-2015 election results to ensure their vote shares being accurate proxies for xenophobia. Furthermore, socioeconomic data such as purchasing power, unemployment rate, and urbanity are used to ensure the studyâ€™s robustness.
